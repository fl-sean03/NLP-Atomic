# Active Context: NLP-Atomic-Backend (2-MVP_Backend)

## Current Work Focus
The immediate focus is on initializing the project structure and core documentation for the "2-MVP_Backend" implementation. This involves:
- Creating the `2-MVP_Backend` directory.
- Populating it with initial (blank or template) `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` files, based on the new project scope (backend-only).
- Updating the symlinks in the workspace root (`PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`) to point to these new files in `2-MVP_Backend/docs/`.
- Creating the `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/` directory.
- Populating this new memory bank with its own set of core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`), reflecting the backend-only nature of this MVP.
- Creating a symlink in the workspace root (`memory-bank`) to point to `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/`.

## Recent Changes
- Completed "Phase 8.5: End-to-End Backend Testing" as per `TASK.md`. This involved running the Flask app locally and performing comprehensive `curl` tests for structure generation, camera rotation, and various error scenarios.
- Verified all expected HTTP status codes and JSON response structures.
- Created the `2-MVP_Backend` directory.
- Created `2-MVP_Backend/PLANNING.md` with content tailored to the backend-only MVP.
- Created `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md` with content tailored to the backend-only MVP.
- Removed old symlinks for `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` in the workspace root.
- Created new symlinks in the workspace root for `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` pointing to `2-MVP_Backend/PLANNING.md` and `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md` respectively.
- Created the `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/` directory.
- Created `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (content updated for backend MVP).
- Created `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/productContext.md` (content updated for backend MVP).
- Created `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (content updated for backend MVP).
- Created `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/techContext.md` (content updated for backend MVP).
- The `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` files within `2-MVP_Backend/` now correctly reference `2-MVP_Backend/` as the active implementation directory.

## Next Steps
1.  Begin Phase 9 of `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md`: "CI/CD & Deployment Prep". This will involve:
    *   Adding GitHub Actions for CI.
    *   Considering Dockerfile creation.
    *   Documenting environment variables.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Backend Focus:** This implementation strictly focuses on the backend API. No frontend code will be developed.
- **Stateless API:** The API will be stateless, as per the `PLANNING.md`.
- **Documentation Granularity:** The `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` for this backend MVP are more detailed and specific to backend concerns, including explicit mention of spec documents like `API_SPEC.md`, `JSON_SCHEMA.md`, etc.
- **Memory Bank Separation:** This new implementation (`2-MVP_Backend`) has its own distinct memory bank to avoid confusion with the previous `1-MVP` full-stack attempt.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First:** Continue to prioritize comprehensive documentation in the `memory-bank`.
- **Modular Design:** Emphasize clear separation of concerns in the backend code (API, NLP, Validation, Execution).
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Unit and integration tests are critical for a robust backend.
- **PEP8 and Black:** Adherence to Python style guidelines.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Switching project scope (e.g., from full-stack to backend-only) requires careful re-initialization of planning documents and the memory bank to maintain clarity and focus.
- Symlinking is a key mechanism for managing multiple implementation contexts within the same workspace.

# Active Context: NLP-Atomic-Backend (2-MVP_Backend)

## Current Work Focus
The NLP-Atomic-Backend project (2-MVP_Backend) is now fully complete. All backend functionalities, documentation, and testing have been finalized.

## Recent Changes
- The entire NLP-Atomic-Backend project (2-MVP_Backend) has been successfully completed, including all development, testing, and documentation phases.
- Final review and release procedures, as outlined in `TASK.md`, have been executed.
- All backend functionalities, including structure generation, command processing, and error handling, have been thoroughly tested and verified.
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment preparations are complete.

## Next Steps
There are no further immediate steps for the NLP-Atomic-Backend project (2-MVP_Backend), as it is now fully complete.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Backend Focus:** This implementation strictly focuses on the backend API. No frontend code will be developed.
- **Stateless API:** The API will be stateless, as per the `PLANNING.md`.
- **Documentation Granularity:** The `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` for this backend MVP are more detailed and specific to backend concerns, including explicit mention of spec documents like `API_SPEC.md`, `JSON_SCHEMA.md`, etc.
- **Memory Bank Separation:** This new implementation (`2-MVP_Backend`) has its own distinct memory bank to avoid confusion with the previous `1-MVP` full-stack attempt.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First:** Continue to prioritize comprehensive documentation in the `memory-bank`.
- **Modular Design:** Emphasize clear separation of concerns in the backend code (API, NLP, Validation, Execution).
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Unit and integration tests are critical for a robust backend.
- **PEP8 and Black:** Adherence to Python style guidelines.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Switching project scope (e.g., from full-stack to backend-only) requires careful re-initialization of planning documents and the memory bank to maintain clarity and focus.
- Symlinking is a key mechanism for managing multiple implementation contexts within the same workspace.

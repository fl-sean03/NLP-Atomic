# Progress: NLP-Atomic-Backend (2-MVP_Backend)

## What Works
- **New Project Directory Created:** `2-MVP_Backend/` directory is set up.
- **Core Planning Documents Initialized:**
    - `2-MVP_Backend/PLANNING.md` created and populated with content specific to the backend-only MVP.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md` created and populated with tasks specific to the backend-only MVP.
- **Workspace Symlinks Updated:**
    - Root `PLANNING.md` now symlinks to `2-MVP_Backend/PLANNING.md`.
    - Root `TASK.md` now symlinks to `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md`.
- **New Memory Bank Initialized:**
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/` directory created.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/projectbrief.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/productContext.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/techContext.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/activeContext.md` created and populated.
- **Documentation Consistency:** `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` within `2-MVP_Backend/` correctly reference `2-MVP_Backend/` as the active implementation directory.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps)
1.  **Commence Phase 1 of `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md` ("Repository & Environment Setup"):**
    *   Set up Python virtual environment for `2-MVP_Backend`.
    *   Create `2-MVP_Backend/requirements.txt`.
    *   Install initial dependencies.
    *   Create `2-MVP_Backend/config.py`.
    *   Set up basic logging in `2-MVP_Backend/utils/logging_setup.py`.
    *   Initialize Git repository (if not already done by user for the workspace).

## Current Status
The project has successfully pivoted to a new implementation focus: "2-MVP_Backend". All foundational planning documents and the dedicated memory bank for this new backend-only MVP have been initialized. The workspace symlinks have been updated to reflect this new active context. The project is now ready to begin the first phase of technical implementation as detailed in `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md`.

## Known Issues
- No known technical issues at this stage. The primary task was restructuring and re-initializing documentation for the new project scope.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Scope Pivot:** The project has shifted from a full-stack MVP (`1-MVP`) to a backend-only MVP (`2-MVP_Backend`). This decision was driven by the user's new instructions.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** All core planning and memory bank documents have been re-created or significantly updated to align with the backend-only focus. This ensures that the AI (Roo) has accurate and relevant context for the current tasks.
- **Symlink Management:** Careful management of symlinks in the workspace root is crucial for allowing the AI to correctly identify and use the active set of planning documents and memory bank files.

# Progress: NLP-Atomic-Backend (2-MVP_Backend)

## What Works
- **New Project Directory Created:** `2-MVP_Backend/` directory is set up.
- **Core Planning Documents Initialized:**
    - `2-MVP_Backend/PLANNING.md` created and populated with content specific to the backend-only MVP.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md` created and populated with tasks specific to the backend-only MVP.
- **Workspace Symlinks Updated:**
    - Root `PLANNING.md` now symlinks to `2-MVP_Backend/PLANNING.md`.
    - Root `TASK.md` now symlinks to `2-MVP_Backend/TASK.md`.
- **New Memory Bank Initialized:**
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/` directory created.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/projectbrief.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/productContext.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/techContext.md` created and populated.
    - `2-MVP_Backend/memory-bank/activeContext.md` created and populated.
- **Documentation Consistency:** `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` within `2-MVP_Backend/` correctly reference `2-MVP_Backend/` as the active implementation directory.

## What's Left to Build (Immediate Next Steps)
The NLP-Atomic-Backend project (2-MVP_Backend) is fully complete. There are no remaining tasks or immediate next steps for this project.

## Current Status
The NLP-Atomic-Backend project (2-MVP_Backend) has been successfully completed. All phases, including development, testing, CI/CD setup, and final review, are finished. The project is now ready for deployment and integration.

## Known Issues
- No known technical issues at this stage. The primary task was restructuring and re-initializing documentation for the new project scope.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Scope Pivot:** The project has shifted from a full-stack MVP (`1-MVP`) to a backend-only MVP (`2-MVP_Backend`). This decision was driven by the user's new instructions.
- **Documentation Overhaul:** All core planning and memory bank documents have been re-created or significantly updated to align with the backend-only focus. This ensures that the AI (Roo) has accurate and relevant context for the current tasks.
- **Symlink Management:** Careful management of symlinks in the workspace root is crucial for allowing the AI to correctly identify and use the active set of planning documents and memory bank files.

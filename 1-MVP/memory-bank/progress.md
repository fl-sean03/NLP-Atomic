# Progress: NL-Atomic-Flask-MVP

## What Works
- **Project Structure Established:** The `1-MVP` directory has been created, and `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` have been moved into it.
- **Symlinks Created:** Symlinks for `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, and `memory-bank` are correctly set up in the workspace root, pointing to their respective locations within `1-MVP/`.
- **Memory Bank Initialized:** The core `memory-bank` files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created and populated with initial content, providing a foundational understanding of the project.
- **Documentation Updated:** `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` have been updated to include the `Active Implementation Directory` reference, ensuring clarity on the current project focus.

## What's Left to Build

### Phase 1: Environment & Project Scaffold
- Set up Python virtual environment.
- Install Flask, OpenAI SDK, and ASE.
- Initialize Git repository (if not already done by the user).
- Scaffold Flask app (`app.py`).
- Define folder structure (`templates/`, `static/js/`, `static/css/`, `models/`).
- Create basic HTML template.
- Set up CSS layout for two columns.
- Verify the empty page with the two-column layout.

### Subsequent Phases (as per TASK.md)
- Phase 2: Viewer Integration
- Phase 3: Natural-Language â†’ Slot Extraction
- Phase 4: ASE-Based Structure Generation
- Phase 5: Chat Pane & AJAX Flow
- Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment

## Current Status
The project is in the initial setup phase. All foundational documentation and directory structuring are complete. The next step is to begin the technical implementation as outlined in Phase 1 of `TASK.md`.

## Known Issues
- No known issues at this stage. The focus has been on setting up the environment and documentation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to create a dedicated `1-MVP` directory and symlink core documents was made to support multiple potential implementations or phases of the project, allowing for clear separation and easy switching between contexts. This aligns with the "Memory Bank Structure" rule.
- The detailed population of the `memory-bank` files is a direct adherence to the rule that "Roo relies ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively."

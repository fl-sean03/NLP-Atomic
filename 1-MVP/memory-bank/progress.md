# Progress: NL-Atomic-Flask-MVP

## What Works
- **Project Structure Established:** The `1-MVP` directory has been created, and `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` have been moved into it.
- **Symlinks Created:** Symlinks for `PLANNING.md`, `TASK.md`, and `memory-bank` are correctly set up in the workspace root, pointing to their respective locations within `1-MVP/`.
- **Memory Bank Initialized:** The core `memory-bank` files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been created and populated with initial content, providing a foundational understanding of the project.
- **Documentation Updated:** `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` have been updated to include the `Active Implementation Directory` reference, ensuring clarity on the current project focus.
- **README.md Created:** A `README.md` file has been created in the workspace root, providing an overview of the project structure and getting started instructions.
- **Initial Commit:** The initial project setup, including the memory bank and `README.md`, has been committed to the Git repository.
- **Phase 1: Environment & Project Scaffold Completed:**
    - Python virtual environment created and activated.
    - Flask, OpenAI SDK, and ASE installed.
    - Flask app (`app.py`) created and configured.
    - Required directories (`templates/`, `static/js/`, `static/css/`, `models/`) created.
    - Basic `index.html` template created with CSS and JS links.
    - CSS layout defined for two columns.
    - Flask app runs successfully, displaying the two-column layout in a browser.

- **Phase 2: Viewer Integration Completed:**
   - 3Dmol.js script included in `1-MVP/templates/index.html`.
   - `div` for 3D viewer added to the left column of `1-MVP/templates/index.html`.
   - Vanilla JavaScript function implemented in `1-MVP/static/js/script.js` to load a structure file from a URL into the viewer.
   - Sample `.pdb` file placed in `1-MVP/static/models/`.
   - JavaScript loader function successfully loads the sample file on page load, allowing rotation/zoom.
   - Debugged and resolved issues causing blank screen and incorrect rendering (race condition, incorrect `$3Dmol.download` usage, missing style application).
   - Refactored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files for better organization.
   - Applied aesthetic improvements to ensure the viewer is correctly contained and does not overlap the header.
   - Implemented performance optimizations in `script.js` for smoother rendering during rotation (strategic `viewer.render()` calls, optimized axes toggle, antialiasing, robust style updates).
   - **"Show Unit Cell" Feature Implemented:**
       - New checkbox for "Show Unit Cell" added to `1-MVP/templates/index.html`.
       - `toggleUnitCell` function implemented in `1-MVP/static/js/script.js` to display a magenta, dashed unit cell based on `CRYST1` data.
       - Debugging ensured correct display and hiding of the unit cell.
   - Created `1-MVP/docs/unit_cell_feature.md` to document the new feature.

## What's Left to Build


### Subsequent Phases (as per TASK.md)
- Phase 3: Natural-Language → Slot Extraction
- Phase 4: ASE-Based Structure Generation
- Phase 5: Chat Pane & AJAX Flow
- Phase 6: Testing & Quality Assurance
- Phase 7: Documentation & Deployment

## Current Status
Phase 1: Environment & Project Scaffold is complete. Phase 2: Viewer Integration is complete. The project now has a functional Flask application scaffold with all initial dependencies installed, a basic HTML page displaying a two-column layout, a 3Dmol.js viewer successfully loading a sample structure, and all aesthetic and performance issues resolved. The next step is to begin Phase 3: Natural-Language → Slot Extraction, as outlined in `TASK.md`.

## Known Issues
- No known issues at this stage. The focus has been on setting up the environment and documentation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- The decision to create a dedicated `1-MVP` directory and symlink core documents was made to support multiple potential implementations or phases of the project, allowing for clear separation and easy switching between contexts. This aligns with the "Memory Bank Structure" rule.
- The detailed population of the `memory-bank` files is a direct adherence to the rule that "Roo relies ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively."

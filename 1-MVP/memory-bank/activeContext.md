# Active Context: NL-Atomic-Flask-MVP

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on completing Phase 2: Viewer Integration, which includes integrating 3Dmol.js, implementing a JavaScript loader, ensuring correct aesthetic layout, and optimizing performance. The project is now ready to proceed to Phase 3: Natural-Language → Slot Extraction.

## Recent Changes
- Created `1-MVP/` directory.
- Moved `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` to `1-MVP/`.
- Created symlinks `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` in the root to `1-MVP/PLANNING.md` and `1-MVP/TASK.md` respectively.
- Created `1-MVP/memory-bank/` directory.
- Created `1-MVP/memory-bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `1-MVP/memory-bank/productContext.md`.
- Created `1-MVP/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`.
- Created `1-MVP/memory-bank/techContext.md`.
- Updated `1-MVP/PLANNING.md` and `1-MVP/TASK.md` to include the `Active Implementation Directory` reference.
- Created symlink `memory-bank` in workspace root pointing to `1-MVP/memory-bank`.
- Initialized Git repository with remote origin set to `https://github.com/fl-sean03/NLP-Atomic.git`.
- Renamed Git branch to `main`.
- Created `README.md` in the workspace root.
- Committed initial project setup to Git.
- **Phase 2: Viewer Integration Completed:**
    - 3Dmol.js script included in `1-MVP/templates/index.html`.
    - `div` for 3D viewer added to the left column of `1-MVP/templates/index.html`.
    - Vanilla JavaScript function implemented in `1-MVP/static/js/script.js` to load a structure file from a URL into the viewer.
    - Sample `.pdb` file placed in `1-MVP/static/models/`.
    - JavaScript loader function successfully loads the sample file on page load, allowing rotation/zoom.
    - Debugged and resolved issues causing blank screen and incorrect rendering (race condition, incorrect `$3Dmol.download` usage, missing style application).
    - Refactored HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files for better organization.
    - Applied aesthetic improvements to ensure the viewer is correctly contained and does not overlap the header.
    - Implemented performance optimizations in `script.js` for smoother rendering during rotation (strategic `viewer.render()` calls, optimized axes toggle, antialiasing, robust style updates).
    - **"Show Unit Cell" Feature Implemented:**
        - New checkbox for "Show Unit Cell" added to `1-MVP/templates/index.html`.
        - `toggleUnitCell` function implemented in `1-MVP/static/js/script.js` to display a magenta, dashed unit cell based on `CRYST1` data.
        - Debugging ensured correct display and hiding of the unit cell.
    - Created `1-MVP/docs/unit_cell_feature.md` to document the new feature.

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3 of the `TASK.md`: "Natural-Language → Slot Extraction".

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project will strictly adhere to the "Flask-only" constraint for the MVP.
- All generated crystal structure files will be saved in `static/models/` to be served directly by Flask.
- The `memory-bank` will be the primary source of truth for project context and progress.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Documentation First:** Comprehensive documentation in the `memory-bank` is crucial due to the memory reset characteristic.
- **Modular Design:** Code will be organized into clear, separated modules.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** New features will have associated Pytest unit tests.
- **PEP8 and Black:** Adherence to Python style guidelines and automatic formatting.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The initial setup involves significant file system manipulation and documentation creation to establish the project's foundational context.
- The symlinking of `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` is critical for maintaining a consistent entry point to the active implementation's documentation from the workspace root.
